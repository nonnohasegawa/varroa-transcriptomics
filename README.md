# Varroa transcriptomics project 
Here I analyze transcriptomic sequence data of _Varroa destructor_, a parasite of the globally distributed western honey bee (_Apis mellifera_), that was collected from various parts of the world, . Varroa mites were originally parasitizing the eastern honey bee (_Apis cerana_), but experienced a host switch after the global spread of _A. mellifera_ in the mid 20th century. 

## Files and directories 
### data
Here you will find all the sample data including metadata. 
**sample-list.xlsx**: contains information on Varroa mite samples we have collected for the study. Includes collection site, date, host and parasite species. 
**NCBI-phylo.xlsx**: contains SRA accession from NCBI, virus name, collection year, region, and host species as well as samples from our study that was used for phylogenetics analysis. 
**summary.xlsx**: contains information of viruses used in variant calling (contig). NCBI SRA accession, length, name, abbreviation.
